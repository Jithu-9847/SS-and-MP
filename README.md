# SS and MP Programs

## Folder Structure


## Folder Details

### MASM

This folder contains assembly language programs written for MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler). The programs cover various algorithms and basic operations:

- [`add16.asm`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/MASM/add16.asm) - Program to add two 16-bit numbers.
- [`Bubble_sort.asm`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/MASM/Bubble_sort.asm) - Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
- [`linear_search.asm`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/MASM/linear_search.asm) - Program to perform linear search on an array.
- [`Palindrome.asm`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/MASM/Palindrome.asm) - Program to check if a string is a palindrome.
- [`Replace.asm`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/MASM/Replace.asm) - Program to replace specific characters in a string.
- [`vowel.asm`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/MASM/vowel.asm) - Program to count the vowels in a string.

### OS / File Allocation

This folder includes C programs related to file allocation methods, commonly used in operating system studies:

- [`Indexed.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/OS%20%2F%20File%20Allocation/Indexed.c) - Demonstrates indexed file allocation.
- [`Linked.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/OS%20%2F%20File%20Allocation/Linked.c) - Demonstrates linked file allocation.
- [`sequential.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/OS%20%2F%20File%20Allocation/sequential.c) - Demonstrates sequential file allocation.
- [`sample_out.txt`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/OS%20%2F%20File%20Allocation/sample_out.txt) - Sample output file for testing or reference.

### SS / Inputs and Outputs

This folder contains C programs and various data files used for input and output in systems programming tasks:

- **C Programs**:
  - [`absolute.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/absolute.c) - Absolute loader program.
  - [`pass1.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/pass1.c) - Pass 1 of a two-pass assembler.
  - [`pass2.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/pass2.c) - Pass 2 of a two-pass assembler.
  - [`reloc.c`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/reloc.c) - Relocating loader program.

- **Input Output Files**:
  - [`assmlist.dat`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/assmlist.dat) - Assembly listing file.
  - [`input.dat`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/input.dat) - Input data file for various programs.
  - [`object.dat`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/object.dat) - Object code file.
  - [`out.dat`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/out.dat) - Output data file.
  - [`symtab.dat`](https://github.com/Jithu-9847/SS-and-MP/blob/main/SS/Inputs%20and%20Outputs/symtab.dat) - Symbol table file.

## Usage

Each folder contains specific files for different tasks. To compile and run the programs:

1. For MASM assembly files, use MASM assembler and linker.
2. For C files, compile them using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc` for Linux-based systems).
3. Some programs may require specific input files in the `Inputs and Outputs` folder.
